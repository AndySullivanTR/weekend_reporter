OUTLOOK MAIL MERGE INSTRUCTIONS:

2. OPEN OUTLOOK
   - Create a new email message (Ctrl+N)
   - Do NOT address it to anyone yet

3. START MAIL MERGE
   - Click the "Mailings" tab (if you don't see it, go to File > Options > Customize Ribbon > check "Mailings")
   - Click "Start Mail Merge" > "Email Messages"

4. SELECT RECIPIENTS

ALTERNATIVE: SIMPLE PYTHON EMAIL SCRIPT
========================================

If Outlook mail merge is difficult or unavailable, you can use the
Python script method instead:

1. Run: python send_notifications.py
2. This will send emails directly via SMTP
3. Requires SMTP server configuration

See: send_notifications.py (to be created if needed)

---

TROUBLESHOOTING:
================

Q: I don't see the Mailings tab in Outlook
A: Go to File > Options > Customize Ribbon > Check "Mailings" > OK

Q: The merge fields aren't showing names/shifts
A: Check that your CSV file has proper headers: Name, Email, Shift1, Shift2

Q: Can I test this before sending to everyone?
A: Yes! In Step 7, use "Edit Individual Messages" instead of "Send Email Messages"
   This creates draft emails you can review before sending.

Q: Some reporters don't have assignments
A: Check data/assignments.json - they may not have submitted preferences
   or were not assigned during allocation.

SECURITY REMINDER:
==================

After sending emails:
1. DELETE the mailmerge CSV file (contains email addresses)
2. Do NOT commit CSV files to git
3. The .gitignore already excludes *mailmerge*.csv files
